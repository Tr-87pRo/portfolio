            Hi, Iâ€™m Damian. I studied Computer Science at XYZ University and have
            worked on multiple exciting web projects. I love creating smooth,
            interactive UI with React, Vite, and Bootstrap. Outside of coding, I
            enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new tech trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            My education journey, skills, and projects reflect my passion for
            clean design and impactful code.
